## get started

We are using a monorepo here. The app is plit between a frontend folder and a backend folder.

## frontend

The frontend was created with create-react-app.

To start the frontend, use
`npm start`

For styling we are using styled-components. Every component has its `ui.js` files where we define the styled components.

Unit tests are implemented with the react-testing-library. To run the tests, use:
`npm test`

## backend
